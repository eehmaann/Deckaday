## Description
One common exercise routine that athletes will do is take a randomly shuffled 
deck of cards and choose each suit to represent a different kind of exercise. 
Then they flip over the cards one by one and do the exercise and reps that were drawn 
(with Jack representing 11, Queen representing 12, king representing 13, 
and Ace representing 14).  This program allows for the user to have this experience, 
without having a physical deck of cards.  When loading the program, the user can select 
four exercises to do among a selection of 16 exercises, with the possibility of selecting 
the same one multiple times.  To keep different profiles, the user must select difficulty.
After pressing start the time will begin, and the user will continue pressing next until
all exercises and reps are completed.  At which time the user will be given a time, and
an opportunity to start a new workout.  
This application was made with Java Version 1.6.0_65.
