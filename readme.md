# Deckaday

## Description
This application is intended to be used for athletes who want to do a workout using a
deck of cards.  The user will be able to assign an exercise to every suit, and the program
will randomly go through the deck of cards, telling the user the exercise and number of
repetitions that must be performed for that card.
The program will track the time it takes to complete the full deck as well as the time 
per type of exercise and give the athlete metrics on which to gauge performance.
This application made with Java 7.  It will currently not compile when under Java 8
